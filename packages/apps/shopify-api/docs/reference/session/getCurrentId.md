# shopify.session.getCurrentId

Extracts the Shopify session id from the given request.

For embedded apps, `shopify.session.getCurrentId` will only be able to find a session id if the request has a session token in the `Authorization` header or URL, that was generated by App Bridge.

Learn more about [making authenticated requests](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth/session-tokens/getting-started#step-2-authenticate-your-requests) using App Bridge.

## Example

```ts
app.get('/fetch-some-data', async (req, res) => {
  const sessionId = await shopify.session.getCurrentId({
    isOnline: true,
    rawRequest: req,
    rawResponse: res,
  });

  // use sessionId to retrieve session from app's session storage
  // getSessionFromStorage() must be provided by application
  const session = await getSessionFromStorage(sessionId);

  // Build a client and make requests with session.accessToken
  // See the REST, GraphQL, or Storefront API documentation for more information
});
```

> **Note**: this method will rely on cookies for non-embedded apps, and the `Authorization` HTTP header for embedded apps using [App Bridge session tokens](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth/session-tokens), making all apps safe to use in modern browsers that block 3rd party cookies.
