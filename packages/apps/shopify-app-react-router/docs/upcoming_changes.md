Shopify apps can now use [OAuth token exchange](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/get-access-tokens/token-exchange) to obtain an API access token without having to redirect the user, which makes the process much faster, and less error prone.

This package will automatically use token exchange, but that only works if [Shopify managed installation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/installation#shopify-managed-installation) is enabled for the app.
Before updating this package in your app, please ensure you've enabled managed installation.

For more details on how this works, please see the [new embedded authorization strategy](../README.md#new-embedded-authorization-strategy) section in the README.
