    'Similarly to how [React Router approaches breaking changes](https://reactrouter.com/6.30.0/guides/api-development-strategy#future-flags), the `@shopify/shopify-app-react-router` package also uses future flags.' +
    "\n\nBigger features and breaking changes are initially added behind a future flag. This means that they're disabled by default, and must be manually enabled by setting the appropriate flag in the `future` option of the `shopifyApp` function." +
    '\n\nThis allows apps to gradually adopt new features, and prepare for breaking changes and major releases ahead of time.',
