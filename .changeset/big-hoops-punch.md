'@shopify/shopify-app-remix': patch
---

Make it clear that you should use `@shopify/shopify-app-react-router` 

Only use `@shopify/shopify-app-remix` if you have an existing Remix app and have not yet upgraded.

If you are building a new Shopify app you should use React Router and not Remix.  Please see the [Quick start guide for React Router](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-react-router?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start).

If you already have a Remix app, you should upgrade to React Router.  Please see the [Upgrading to React Router guide](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-react-router/wiki/Upgrading-from-Remix).
